# 1. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.

def radius():
    rad = int(input("enter the radius of a circle to compute the area? "))
    area = (rad * rad) * 3.14
    print(f"the area of the circle is {area}")

# radius()

# 2. Write a Python program to count the number of times letter ‘a’ appears in given list(using loops).

def cnta():
    aa = input("enter a sentence with the letter 'a' appearing multiple times? ")

    count = 0

    for i in aa:
        if 'a' in i:
            count += 1

    print(f"the number of a's in the sentence {count}")

# cnta()

# 3. Write a Python program to sum of two given integers. However, if the sum is between 15 to 20 it will return 20.

def sum2(x, y):
    x = int(input("enter x? "))
    y = int(input("enter y? "))

    sum = x + y

    if sum in range(15,21):
        print("answer is 20")
    else:
        print(f"answer is {sum}")

# sum2(10,2)
# sum2(10,6)
# sum2(15,6)
